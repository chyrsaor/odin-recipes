        <h2>A dish made by baking such pasta with layers of sauce and fillings such as cheese or meat.</h2>
        <p> A family-pleasing version of lasagna is made with lean ground beef, whole wheat lasagna noodles, prepared sauce, and plenty of mozzarella for a dish that's easy yet hearty.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 (26 ounce) jars pasta sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Add mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Lay down 1/2 of the lasagna noodles and layer 1/2 each of the ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese on top. Repeat layering again with noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ul>
